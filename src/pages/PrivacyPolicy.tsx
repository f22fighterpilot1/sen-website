        <h1>SymbolicEngine Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p className="muted">Last updated: January 11, 2026</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          SymbolicEngine, Inc. (“SymbolicEngine,” “SEN,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)
          respects your privacy and is committed to protecting personal data in a
          manner consistent with our mission as a deterministic, auditable
          infrastructure provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect
          personal data when you interact with SymbolicEngine, including when you
          visit our websites, create or manage an account, use our services or
          documentation, or communicate with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          SymbolicEngine is not an advertising platform, consumer social service,
          or data brokerage. Our systems—and our data practices—are designed around
          minimal collection, clear purpose limitation, and inspectability.
        </p>

          as part of enterprise or cloud services, such processing is governed by
          applicable customer agreements and Data Processing Addenda (DPAs), not
          this Privacy Policy.

          SymbolicEngine uses limited, first-party analytics to understand

        <p>
          Cookies are limited to essential session functionality and security.
          Non-essential cookies may be disabled via browser settings; essential
          cookies are required for secure operation.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disclosure, Retention, and International Processing</h2>
        <p>
          Personal data may be disclosed only to trusted service providers under
          strict confidentiality, to comply with legal obligations, or as part of
          a legitimate business transaction. We do not disclose personal data for
          advertising or monetization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data is retained only as long as necessary for operational, security,
          and legal purposes, after which it is securely deleted or anonymized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where personal data is processed internationally, SymbolicEngine
          implements appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.
        </p>

          Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to access,
          correct, delete, restrict, or receive a portable copy of your personal
          data, or to withdraw consent where applicable. Requests may be submitted
          by contacting us below. We do not discriminate against individuals for
          exercising privacy rights.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Security, Children’s Privacy, and Updates</h2>
