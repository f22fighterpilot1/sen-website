        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of the
          websites, documentation, demos, developer tools, and related online
          services (collectively, the “Service”) provided by SymbolicEngine, Inc.
          (“SymbolicEngine,” “SEN,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).
        </p>

        <p>
          By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do
          not agree, you may not use the Service.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity, you represent that
          you have authority to bind that entity, and these Terms apply to that

        </p>

        <h2>1. Scope of These Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms apply to:</p>

          These Terms do not govern enterprise production deployments, which are

          the separate written agreement controls.
